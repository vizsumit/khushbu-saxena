      are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Catfish are named for their
      prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, though not all catfish
      have prominent barbels. All siluriformes lack scales, including both the
      armour-plated and naked species. This order of fish are defined by
      features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish range in size and behavior
      from the three largest species alive, the Mekong giant catfish from
      Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia, and the piraíba of South
      America, to detritivorous and scavenging bottom feeders, down to the tiny
      ectoparasitic species known as the candiru.

      Catfish do not have scales; their bodies are often naked. In some species,
      their mucus-covered skin is used in cutaneous respiration, where the fish
      breathes through its skin.[7] In some catfish, the skin is covered in bony
      plates called scutes; some form of body armor appears in various ways
      within the order. In loricarioids and in the Asian genus Sisor, the armor
      is primarily made up of one or more rows of free dermal plates. Similar
      plates are found in large specimens of Lithodoras. These plates may be
      supported by vertebral processes, as in scoloplacids and in Sisor, but the
      processes never fuse to the plates or form any external armor. By
      contrast, in the subfamily Doumeinae (family Amphiliidae) and in
      hoplomyzontines (Aspredinidae), the armor is formed solely by expanded
      vertebral processes that form plates. Finally, the lateral armor of
      doradids, Sisor, and hoplomyzontines consists of hypertrophied lateral
      line ossicles with dorsal and ventral lamina.

      <b><span>S</span>tarfish</b> or sea stars are a class of marine
      invertebrates generally shaped like a star polygon. (In common usage,
      these names are also often applied to ophiuroids, which are correctly
      referred to as brittle stars or basket stars.) Starfish are also known as
      asteroids because they form the taxonomic class Asteroidea
      (/ˌæstəˈrɔɪdiə/). About 1,900 species of starfish live on the seabed, and
      are found in all the world's oceans, from warm, tropical zones to frigid,
      polar regions. They can occur from the intertidal zone down to abyssal
      depths, at 6,000 m (20,000 ft) below the surface.

      Starfish are echinoderms and typically have a central disc and usually
      five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or
      upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with
      overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades
      of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube
      feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre of the oral
      or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators
      on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding
      behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding.
      They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and
      asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can
      shed arms as a means of defense.

      <b><span>S</span>harks</b> are a group of elasmobranch cartilaginous
      fishes characterized by a ribless endoskeleton, dermal denticles, five to
      seven gill slits on each side, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the
      head. Modern sharks are classified within the division Selachii[1] and are
      the sister group to the Batomorphi (rays and skates). Some sources extend
      the term "shark" as an informal category including extinct members of
      Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a shark-like morphology, such as
      hybodonts. Shark-like chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus
      first appeared in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some
      fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late Ordovician
      (458–444 million years ago).[2] The earliest confirmed modern sharks
      (Selachii) are known from the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago,
      with the oldest known member being Agaleus, though records of true sharks
      may extend back as far as the Permian.
