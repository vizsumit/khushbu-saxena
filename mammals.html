    <h1>Mammals</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      <b><span>H</span>umans(Homo sapiens) </b> are primates that belong to the
      biological family of great apes, characterized by hairlessness,
      bipedality, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more
      advanced cognitive skills that facilitate successful adaptation to varied
      environments, development of sophisticated tools, and formation of complex
      social structures and civilizations.

      Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a
      multi-layered network of distinct social groups â€“ from families and peer
      groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions
      between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms,
      languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of
      which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire
      to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development
      of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other
      frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains
      as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of
      2025, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion living humans.

      <b><span>K</span>angaroo</b> are marsupials from the subfamily
      Macropodinae (macropods, meaning "large foot"). In common use, the term is
      used to describe the largest species from this family, the red kangaroo,
      as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western
      grey kangaroo.[1] Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.
      The Australian government estimates that 42.8 million kangaroos lived
      within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2
      million in 2013.[2]

      Kangaroo have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a
      long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials,
      female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete
      postnatal development.

      Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized
      teeth that are rare among mammals. Its incisors are able to crop grass
      close to the ground and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two
      sides of the lower jaw are not joined or fused together, the lower
      incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica
      in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars are ground down and they actually
      move forward in the mouth before they eventually fall out, and are
      replaced by new teeth that grow in the back.[5] This process is known as
      polyphyodonty and, amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and
      manatees.

      <b><span>P</span>latypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus)</b>, sometimes
      referred to as the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying
      mammal endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is
      the sole living representative of its family Ornithorhynchidae and genus
      Ornithorhynchus, though a number of related species appear in the fossil
      record. Together with the four species of echidna, it is one of the five
      extant species of monotremes, mammals that lay eggs instead of giving
      birth to live young. Like other monotremes, the platypus has a sense of
      electrolocation, which it uses to detect prey in water while its eyes,
      ears and nostrils are closed. It is one of the few species of venomous
      mammals, as the male platypus has a spur on each hind foot that delivers
      an extremely painful venom.

      The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed
      mammal at first baffled European naturalists. In 1799, the first
      scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of
      several animals sewn together. The unique features of the platypus make it
      important in the study of evolutionary biology, and a recognisable and
      iconic symbol of Australia. It is culturally significant to several
      Aboriginal peoples, who also used to hunt it for food, and has appeared on
      stamps and currency.
