      <b><span>F</span>rog</b>is any member of a diverse and largely semiaquatic
      group of short-bodied, tailless amphibian vertebrates composing the order
      Anura[1] (coming from the Ancient Greek ἀνούρα, literally 'without tail').
      Frog species with rough skin texture due to wart-like parotoid glands tend
      to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is
      informal and purely cosmetic, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.

      Adult frogs have a stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached
      tongue, limbs folded underneath, and no tail (the "tail" of tailed frogs
      is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with
      secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour
      from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green, to vivid patterns of
      bright red or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators.
      Adult frogs live in both fresh water and on dry land; some species are
      adapted for living underground or in trees. As their skin is
      semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, they either live
      in moist niches or have special adaptations to deal with drier habitats.
      Frogs produce a wide range of vocalisations, particularly in their
      breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to
      attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.

      <b><span>C</span>aecilians (/sɪˈsɪliən/</b>; New Latin for 'blind ones')
      are a group of limbless, worm-shaped or snake-shaped amphibians with
      either small eyes or no eyes. They mostly live hidden in soil or in
      streambeds, making them some of the least familiar amphibians. Modern
      caecilians live in the tropics of South and Central America, Africa, and
      southern Asia. Caecilians feed on small subterranean creatures, such as
      earthworms. The body is noodle-like and often dark in colour, and the
      skull is bullet-shaped and strongly built. Caecilian heads have several
      unique adaptations, such as fused skull and jaw bones, a two-part system
      of jaw muscles, and chemosensory tentacles between the eyes and nostrils.
      The skin is slimy, with ringlike markings or grooves, and in some species
      hides scales underneath.

      Caecilians' anatomy is highly adapted for a burrowing lifestyle. In a
      couple of species, belonging to the primitive genus Ichthyophis, vestigial
      traces of limbs have been found, and in Typhlonectes compressicauda the
      presence of limb buds has been observed during embryonic development,
      remnants in an otherwise completely limbless body.[7] This makes the
      smaller species resemble worms, while the larger species like Caecilia
      thompsoni, with lengths up to 1.5 m (5 ft), resemble snakes. Their tails
      are short or absent, and their cloacae are near the ends of their bodies.

      <b> <span>T</span>iger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) </b>is a species of
      mole salamander[1] and one of the largest terrestrial salamanders in North
      America.

      These salamanders usually grow to a length of 6–8 in (15–20 cm) with a
      lifespan of around 12–15 years.[5] They are characterized by having
      markings varying in color on the back of their head, body, and tail.[6]
      The coloring of these spots range from brownish yellow to greenish yellow,
      while the rest of their back is black or dark brown.[2] They are smooth
      bodied, with costal grooves running down their sides to aid in moisture
      control.[7] They have short snouts, thick necks, strong legs, and lengthy
      tails.[8] Tiger salamanders also utilize specialized foot pads for
      burrowing.[9]Tiger salamanders are a sexually dimorphic species, as the
      males are larger in body size, as well as have longer and higher tails
      than females.[10] Some individuals, typically when their aquatic
      environment is well suited, will retain their larval characteristics and
      forego metamorphosis. This is known as facultative paedomorphosis.[11]
      These paedomorphic individuals retain their gills and remain aquatic.[12]
      Their diet consists largely of small insects, snails, slugs, frogs, and
      worms, although it is not rare for an adult to turn cannibalistic and
      consume its own kind.[6][13] Cannibalism in these salamanders can almost
      always be traced back to a large volume of competing predators and lack of
      prey in the area.[14] If the opportunity presents itself, tiger
      salamanders will even feed on other smaller salamander species, lizards,
      snakelets (baby snakes), and newborn mice.[13][15] When threatened, these
      salamanders will display their tail, which will then secrete a thick,
      white, poisonous substance from their granular skin glands to warn
      predators.[16] Pads on their feet help them dig through loose soil. [17]
