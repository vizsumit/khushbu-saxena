    <h1>Birds</h1>
    <p class="indent">
      <b><span>E</span>agle</b> is the common name for the golden eagle, bald
      eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae. Eagles
      belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related.
      True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles
      are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be
      found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three
      in Australia.

    <p>
      Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors
      and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly
      debated[according to whom?] which should be considered the largest species
      of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or
      wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in
      variable measurements from species to species. For example, many
      forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have
      relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver
      in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in
      the genus Aquila, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for
      their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.[13]

      <b><span>P</span>arrots (Psittaciformes)</b>, also known as psittacines
      (/ˈsɪtəsaɪnz/),[1][2] are birds with a strong curved beak, upright stance,
      and clawed feet.[a] They are classified in four families that contain
      roughly 410 species in 101 genera, found mostly in tropical and
      subtropical regions. The four families are the Psittaculidae (Old World
      parrots), Psittacidae (African and New World parrots), Cacatuidae
      (cockatoos), and Strigopidae (New Zealand parrots). One-third of all
      parrot species are threatened by extinction, with a higher aggregate
      extinction risk (IUCN Red List Index) than any other comparable bird
      group.[3] Parrots have a generally pantropical distribution with several
      species inhabiting temperate regions as well. The greatest diversity of
      parrots is in South America[4] and Australasia.[5]

    <p>
      Parrots—along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies—are among the most
      intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech
      enhances their popularity as pets. They form the most variably sized bird
      order in terms of length; many are vividly coloured and some,
      multi-coloured. Most parrots exhibit little or no sexual dimorphism in the
      visual spectrum.

      <b><span>C</span>row</b> is a bird of the genus Corvus, or more broadly, a
      synonym for all of Corvus. The word "crow" is used as part of the common
      name of many species. The related term "raven" is not linked
      scientifically to any certain trait but is rather a general grouping for
      larger-sized species of Corvus. The collective name for a group of crows
      is a "murder".[
