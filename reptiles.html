      <b><span>S</span>nakes</b> are elongated limbless reptiles of the suborder
      Serpentes (/sɜːrˈpɛntiːz/).[2] Cladistically squamates, snakes are
      ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales much like
      other members of the group. Many species of snakes have skulls with
      several more joints than their lizard ancestors and relatives, enabling
      them to swallow prey much larger than their heads (cranial kinesis). To
      accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys)
      appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most only
      have one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair
      of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca. Lizards have
      independently evolved elongate bodies without limbs or with greatly
      reduced limbs at least twenty-five times via convergent evolution, leading
      to many lineages of legless lizards.[3] These resemble snakes, but several
      common groups of legless lizards have eyelids and external ears, which
      snakes lack, although this rule is not universal (see Amphisbaenia,
      Dibamidae, and Pygopodidae).

      Most species of snake are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it
      primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense. Some
      possess venom that is potent enough to cause painful injury or death to
      humans. Nonvenomous snakes either swallow prey alive or kill by
      constriction.

      <b><span>T</span>urtles</b> are reptiles of the order Testudines,
      characterized by a special shell developed mainly from their ribs. Modern
      turtles are divided into two major groups, the Pleurodira (side necked
      turtles) and Cryptodira (hidden necked turtles), which differ in the way
      the head retracts. There are 360 living and recently extinct species of
      turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They
      are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea
      turtles, much of the ocean. Like other amniotes (reptiles, birds, and
      mammals) they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many
      species live in or around water.

      Turtles have appeared in myths and folktales around the world. Some
      terrestrial and freshwater species are widely kept as pets. Turtles have
      been hunted for their meat, for use in traditional medicine, and for their
      shells. Sea turtles are often killed accidentally as bycatch in fishing
      nets. Turtle habitats around the world are being destroyed. As a result of
      these pressures, many species are extinct or threatened with extinction.

      <b><span>C</span>rocodiles (family Crocodylidae) </b>or true crocodiles
      are large, semiaquatic reptiles that live throughout the tropics in
      Africa, Asia, the Americas and Australia. The term "crocodile" is
      sometimes used more loosely to include all extant members of the order
      Crocodilia, which includes the alligators and caimans (both members of the
      family Alligatoridae), the gharial and false gharial (both members of the
      family Gavialidae) as well as other extinct taxa. Quick facts Scientific

      Crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ among species.
      However, they have many similarities in these areas as well. All
      crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats
      such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and
      saltwater. They are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates
      such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates
      such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. All
      crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators, are very
      sensitive to cold. Many species are at the risk of extinction, some being
      classified as critically endangered.
